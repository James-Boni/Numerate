We have a critical mobile UI bug in Quick Fire:

- The Quick Fire tab/button in the Train menu displays in a central position on mobile and is unreadable.
- There are TWO exit buttons overlapping each other in Quick Fire.
- Only one exit works, and it works unreliably (touch sometimes doesn’t register).

This must be fixed properly (layout + stacking + touch interception). Do NOT add new features.

====================================================================
A) FIX TRAIN MENU QUICK FIRE CARD/TAB ON MOBILE
====================================================================
Goal: Quick Fire entry must be readable and properly laid out on mobile.

1) Inspect Train menu layout on small screens:
- Ensure Quick Fire card/tab follows the same layout rules as Daily card.
- Ensure text wraps properly and does not render centered in an unreadable way.
- Use responsive constraints:
  - consistent padding
  - left-aligned text where appropriate
  - font size not shrinking too far
  - no absolute positioning that causes center overlap

2) Fix style issues causing unreadable center positioning:
- Remove any absolute positioning or transform that anchors it to center incorrectly.
- Ensure card height adapts to content.
- Ensure labels and stats under Quick Fire (PB / attempts) are readable and aligned.

Acceptance:
- On mobile viewport, Quick Fire card is readable with no overlapping text and consistent alignment with other modes.

====================================================================
B) REMOVE DUPLICATE EXIT BUTTONS (OVERLAP FIX)
====================================================================
Goal: There must be EXACTLY ONE exit/back button visible in Quick Fire.

1) Find why two exit buttons exist:
Common causes:
- A screen header back button PLUS an in-screen close button
- A modal overlay close icon PLUS a navigation header
- Two components rendering headers simultaneously

2) Choose ONE canonical exit control:
Recommended:
- A single top-left back arrow/button OR a single “X” close button (pick one consistent with Daily screens).
- Do NOT render both.

3) Ensure the removed button is not still present but invisible (touch-blocking).
- Search for overlays with opacity 0 or transparent views intercepting touches.

Acceptance:
- Only one exit control exists visually AND in the view tree.

====================================================================
C) MAKE EXIT BUTTON 100% RELIABLE (TOUCH + Z-INDEX)
====================================================================
Goal: Tap always works, instantly.

1) Fix stacking and touch interception:
- Ensure the exit button is on top (zIndex / elevation).
- Ensure no overlapping View is intercepting touches:
  - check pointerEvents
  - check absolute-positioned overlays
  - check full-screen Pressable used for tap-to-submit that might cover header

2) If Quick Fire uses “tap anywhere to submit”:
- The full-screen Pressable must EXCLUDE the header area.
- The header (exit button area) must not be inside the tap-to-submit overlay.
- Use a layout split:
  - Header region (non-intercepted by submit overlay)
  - Gameplay region (tap-to-submit active)
  - Keypad region (digits only)

3) Increase touch target:
- Add hitSlop to exit button.
- Ensure minimum 44x44dp tap area.
- Respect Safe Area / notch (top padding).

Acceptance:
- Exit button works every tap on mobile.
- No missed taps, no needing multiple presses.
- Works on iOS safe-area devices.

====================================================================
D) VERIFY QUICK FIRE POPUP “X” CANCEL ALSO WORKS
====================================================================
If you show the Quick Fire explanation popup each time:
- Its “X” must cancel back to Train menu
- It must not be overlapped by another exit control
- Ensure only one close control is active at a time (modal close OR screen exit, never both stacked)

Acceptance:
- Modal X always closes modal and returns to menu reliably.

====================================================================
E) DELIVERABLES
====================================================================
After fixing:
- List which components contained duplicate exit buttons
- Explain which one you kept and where it lives
- Confirm the tap-to-submit overlay no longer covers the header
- Provide a short note on what caused the unreadable Quick Fire card and how it was fixed
