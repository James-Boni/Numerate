Sound is now playing, but the current SFX are totally wrong and playback latency is too slow. I need a focused refactor of sound assets + sound engine timing. Do NOT add new features.

1) Replace the SFX assets with appropriate micro-feedback sounds
Current issues:
- “Correct” sounds like a grocery store scanner beep (bad)
- “Incorrect” is a long trumpet/jingle (very bad; way too long)

Requirements for new sounds:
- Correct SFX: short, clean, satisfying “tick/click/chime”, NOT a beep; duration 60–140ms
- Incorrect SFX: short, muted “thud/tock”, NOT a buzzer/jingle; duration 60–160ms
- Tick SFX (countdown): very short, soft tick; duration 30–80ms

All sounds must:
- be unobtrusive and not cheesy
- feel modern/minimal (adult UI feedback, not cartoon)
- be quiet enough for repetition
- be bundled locally in src/assets/sounds/

If you cannot source better files automatically, generate or include placeholder micro SFX that match these constraints, and ensure they are SHORT by editing/trimming the files. The wrong sound must not exceed 160ms.

2) Fix sound playback latency (it must be instant)
Current problem: sounds play late and overlap into the next question. This is unacceptable.

Implement a low-latency sound engine using expo-av:
- Preload sounds ONCE when the game screen mounts (or app mounts)
- Reuse Audio.Sound instances (do not create a new Audio.Sound per answer)
- Ensure playCorrect/playWrong calls are synchronous-feeling:
  - use setPositionAsync(0) then playAsync()
  - do not await slow operations inside the answer-confirm path
- Log timestamps:
  - at answer submit
  - at confirmation (correct/wrong)
  - immediately before calling playAsync
This should prove latency is minimal.

Also ensure:
- sounds do not overlap:
  - stopAsync() (or replay from 0) before playing again
  - especially the wrong sound (must never bleed into next question)

3) Synchronize UI feedback timing with sounds
Requirement:
- Sound must finish before the next question is displayed.
- If necessary, hold the “wrong answer” feedback on screen slightly longer so the sound can complete.

Specific behavior:
- Correct answer:
  - play correct SFX immediately on confirmation
  - show green flash ≤120ms
  - advance to next question immediately (or within ≤80ms)
- Wrong answer:
  - play wrong SFX immediately on confirmation
  - show red state + correct answer text for a controlled delay (e.g., 250–400ms)
  - only then advance to next question
  - ensure wrong SFX is complete by the time next question renders

4) Prevent countdown tick from interfering with answer sounds
- If an answer is submitted during the last 10 seconds, suppress the tick sound for that second so answer feedback is dominant.
- Tick must never overlap the wrong/correct sound.

5) Acceptance criteria (must meet)
- Correct and wrong sounds are short and match the minimalist aesthetic (no beep, no trumpet/jingle)
- Sound plays instantly on submit/confirmation (no noticeable delay)
- Wrong sound never continues into the next question
- Confirm with on-device testing (iPhone Expo Go/TestFlight) and provide brief notes on what changed (assets replaced, preload implemented, delay timing chosen).
