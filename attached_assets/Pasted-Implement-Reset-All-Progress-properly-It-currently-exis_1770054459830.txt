Implement “Reset All Progress” properly. It currently exists in Settings but does nothing. Make it fully functional with correct UX, correct data integrity, and strict scoping.

DO NOT change assessment logic or rerun assessment automatically.
DO NOT affect account identity, entitlements/subscription, or user preferences.
This is a destructive action and must require confirmation.

====================================================================
A) PRODUCT INTENT (LOCKED)
====================================================================
- Users can reset progress/history/stats, but NOT their assessed ability.
- Reset returns the user to the level determined by their initial assessment.
- Assessment placement (and any backend grouping) remains unchanged.
- Reset must be reversible only by future play (no undo needed, but must confirm before doing it).

====================================================================
B) UI / UX REQUIREMENTS
====================================================================
1) Settings placement:
- Keep “Reset All Progress” inside a “Danger Zone” section in Settings.
- Style as destructive (red icon/text).

2) Confirmation modal (MANDATORY):
When user taps “Reset All Progress”, show a confirmation dialog:

Title:
“Reset all progress?”

Body:
“This will erase your progress and statistics. Your level will return to the one determined by your initial assessment.”

Buttons:
- “Cancel” (default/secondary)
- “Reset Progress” (destructive/red)

3) Behavior:
- Tapping Cancel closes dialog and does nothing.
- Tapping Reset Progress executes the reset immediately and reliably.

4) Post-action feedback:
- After reset completes, show a short, calm toast/banner:
  “Progress reset. You’re back at Level X.”
- Then return to a sensible screen (Settings remains fine, or optionally navigate to Train).

====================================================================
C) EXACT BACKEND / STATE CHANGES
====================================================================
Reset MUST do the following (and only the following):

✅ RESET THESE (progress/history/stats):
- user.level  -> set to user.initialAssessmentLevel
- user.xp / xpIntoLevel / xpTotal -> reset to the baseline for that assessment level
- progress history used by Progress page charts -> clear
- streaks -> reset (e.g. dayStreak = 0)
- Personal Bests (daily records) -> reset
- Quick Fire stats (PB, attempts, any quickfire history) -> reset
- Recent sessions list -> clear (or clear only “daily/quick_fire” session records if that’s how it’s stored)

❌ DO NOT RESET THESE (must remain untouched):
- initial assessment result metrics (starting placement)
- starting group (if stored)
- account/user id
- entitlements / subscription state
- preferences (sound, haptics, reminders, UI settings)
- any auth session / tokens

Important: Reset must NOT re-run the assessment. It must simply restore the initialAssessmentLevel.

If user.initialAssessmentLevel is missing or invalid:
- Fail safely: show an error toast:
  “Reset unavailable until you complete the assessment.”
- Do not partially reset anything.

====================================================================
D) SINGLE SOURCE OF TRUTH + PERSISTENCE
====================================================================
- user.level must remain the single source of truth after reset.
- Ensure ALL persistent stores are updated consistently:
  - in-memory store
  - local persistence (AsyncStorage/localStorage/etc.)
  - backend DB (if present)
- The Progress page should immediately reflect empty history after reset (no stale cached values).

====================================================================
E) DATA MODEL REQUIREMENTS (IF NOT ALREADY PRESENT)
====================================================================
If the app does not already store these, add them:

- user.initialAssessmentLevel: number
  - set once at assessment completion
  - never overwritten by reset

- user.hasCompletedAssessment: boolean
  - required for gating and for reset eligibility

Ensure assessment completion writes initialAssessmentLevel deterministically.

====================================================================
F) ACCEPTANCE TESTS (MUST PASS)
====================================================================
1) User completes assessment and gets placed at Level N.
2) User plays Daily sessions, levels up, generates history, PBs, streaks.
3) User goes to Settings -> Reset All Progress -> confirmation appears.
4) Cancel does nothing.
5) Reset Progress does all of:
   - level becomes N again
   - XP becomes baseline for Level N
   - charts become empty / “More data will appear as you train.”
   - streak = 0
   - PBs cleared
   - Quick Fire attempts/PB cleared
   - subscription and preferences unchanged
6) App reload / refresh: the reset persists (no old data returns).

====================================================================
G) REPORTING
====================================================================
After implementing, return:
- which files were changed
- where reset logic lives
- which store keys are cleared
- confirmation that entitlements/preferences are untouched
