We now have a NEW logo asset with TRUE transparency (alpha channel). The previous logo asset with a white rounded-square background must be fully replaced.

This is a replacement task, not a styling task.

====================================================================
A) REPLACE THE LOGO ASSET
====================================================================
1) Locate the existing Numerate logo asset used for:
- loading / splash screen
- any in-app logo usage
- placement or celebration screens

2) Remove the old logo asset entirely (the one with a white rounded-square baked into the image).

3) Replace it with the newly uploaded transparent logo asset.
- This asset already has transparency.
- Do NOT modify it.
- Do NOT wrap it in a background container.

====================================================================
B) STRICT RENDERING RULES (VERY IMPORTANT)
====================================================================
When rendering the logo:

❌ Do NOT:
- add a background color
- add a white container
- add a rounded rectangle behind it
- simulate transparency with matching colors

✅ DO:
- render the image directly
- allow the page background to show through naturally

The logo should appear as JUST the brain shape.

====================================================================
C) SPLASH / LOADING SCREEN
====================================================================
- Keep the splash screen background white.
- Place the transparent logo centered on the screen.
- There must be NO visible box or border around the logo.
- The logo should blend seamlessly into the white background.

====================================================================
D) ACCEPTANCE TEST (MANDATORY)
====================================================================
1) Render the logo on a pure white background.
2) There must be NO visible bounding box.
3) Zoom in: no white pixels outside the brain silhouette.
4) Compare old vs new — the harsh border must be completely gone.

If ANY white rounded square is visible, the task is NOT complete.

====================================================================
E) REPORT BACK
====================================================================
Confirm:
- Old logo asset removed
- New transparent asset is in use
- File path(s) where the logo is referenced
- That no container background is applied
