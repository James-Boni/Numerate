We are correcting Quick Fire integration issues. These are NOT feature additions; they are structural fixes. Do NOT add new UI beyond what is explicitly requested. Do NOT leave partial behavior in place.

====================================================================
A) METRICS SEPARATION (CRITICAL)
====================================================================
Quick Fire statistics MUST NOT affect global user performance metrics.

Rules:
1) Quick Fire sessions must NEVER contribute to:
   - overall accuracy
   - overall speed
   - overall consistency
   - progress page trends
2) Only Daily sessions contribute to:
   - Progress page graphs
   - Global accuracy/speed metrics
3) Quick Fire exists to encourage experimentation and speed training.
   - High failure rate is expected
   - User must never be penalized for failing Quick Fire

Implementation:
- Tag all Quick Fire sessions strictly as sessionType = "quick_fire"
- When computing:
   - progress metrics
   - global averages
   - trend lines
  explicitly FILTER OUT sessionType === "quick_fire"

Acceptance:
- Playing Quick Fire does not lower or change progress metrics shown on Progress page.

====================================================================
B) QUICK FIRE STATS LOCATION (TRAIN MENU ONLY)
====================================================================
Quick Fire statistics must live ONLY under Quick Fire in the Train menu.

Under the Quick Fire button/card in Train:
- Show:
  - Personal Best (highest score)
  - Number of attempts
- Do NOT show:
  - accuracy
  - speed
  - global metrics

These stats are informational, not evaluative.

Acceptance:
- User can see Quick Fire personal best + attempts in Train menu.
- No Quick Fire data appears in Progress page metrics.

====================================================================
C) REMOVE TRAIN MENU METRICS (GLOBAL)
====================================================================
The Train menu must not show accuracy or speed at all.

Rules:
- Train menu purpose = mode selection
- Remove any display of:
  - accuracy
  - speed
  - progress metrics
from Train menu UI

Acceptance:
- Train menu shows only game modes.
- No accuracy/speed text appears except inside specific game summaries.

====================================================================
D) REMOVE REDUNDANT QUICK FIRE LABELS
====================================================================
Under Quick Fire in the Train menu:
- REMOVE the following static text:
  - “5s + 5s / correct”
  - “1 mistake = done”

These rules are explained via the popup and do not belong in the menu.

Acceptance:
- Those two labels no longer appear anywhere.

====================================================================
E) QUICK FIRE EXPLANATION POPUP (EVERY TIME)
====================================================================
The Quick Fire explanation popup must appear EVERY TIME the user starts Quick Fire.

Rules:
- Remove any quickFireIntroSeen / first-time-only logic.
- On every tap of Quick Fire:
  - show explanation popup
  - user must tap “Okay” to proceed
  - “X” cancels and returns to Train menu

Popup behavior:
- “Okay” → start countdown
- “X” → cancel and return to menu

Acceptance:
- Popup appears every time.
- User can always back out safely.

====================================================================
F) QUICK FIRE UI PARITY WITH DAILY (NON-NEGOTIABLE)
====================================================================
Quick Fire answer input and feedback must behave EXACTLY like Daily.

Required behavior:
1) NO answer box UI
2) White background answer display
3) User taps anywhere outside keypad to submit
4) Correct answer:
   - full-screen GREEN flash
   - same correct SFX as Daily
5) Incorrect answer / timeout:
   - full-screen RED flash
   - same wrong SFX as Daily

Remove any Quick Fire–specific answer UI that differs from Daily.

Acceptance:
- Visually and interactively indistinguishable from Daily input experience.

====================================================================
G) XP SUMMARY DISPLAY BUG FIX
====================================================================
Bug:
- Quick Fire summary shows “0 XP”
- But XP is actually applied to level correctly

Fix:
- Quick Fire summary MUST display finalSessionXP
- The value shown must be EXACTLY the same number that:
  - was applied to user XP
  - appears under the user’s level

Rules:
- finalSessionXP = inGameXP + bonusXP
- Summary screen must display finalSessionXP
- Do NOT recompute XP inside summary UI
- Read from the stored session result

Acceptance:
- If XP increases under the level indicator, the same number appears in the Quick Fire summary.

====================================================================
H) DATA INTEGRITY CHECK (CONSOLE ONLY)
====================================================================
At the end of a Quick Fire session, log:

QUICKFIRE_SUMMARY
score=__
attempts=__
correct=__
finalSessionXP=__
appliedXP=__

No new debug UI.

====================================================================
DELIVERABLES
====================================================================
After completing changes, report:
- Which files were modified
- Where Quick Fire is filtered out of global metrics
- Where Quick Fire stats are stored and rendered in Train menu
- Confirmation that XP summary now matches applied XP
