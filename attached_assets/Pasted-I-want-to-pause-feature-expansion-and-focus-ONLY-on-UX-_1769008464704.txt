I want to pause feature expansion and focus ONLY on UX risk mitigation. Please review and adjust the following areas carefully. Do not add new features; only refine behavior, timing, and interaction quality.

1) Correct / Wrong feedback intensity (CRITICAL)
This app targets users who may feel anxious or insecure about maths.

Requirements:
- Ensure green/red screen flashes are LOW OPACITY and VERY BRIEF (≤120ms).
- Red feedback must feel neutral, not punitive.
- No aggressive shaking, buzzing, or flashing.
- Visual feedback should confirm the outcome, not dominate attention.
- If the same user gets several wrong answers in a row, feedback must NOT escalate in intensity.

Goal:
Users should feel safe to continue, not tense or embarrassed.

2) Sound feedback fatigue check
Sounds are helpful but dangerous if overused.

Requirements:
- Correct and wrong sounds must be short (<150ms) and quiet relative to system volume.
- No sound stacking or overlapping.
- Sounds must remain tolerable over long sessions (30–50 answers).
- Respect sound toggle everywhere, including countdown ticking.
- If multiple events happen at once (e.g., answer + timer tick), prioritize answer feedback and suppress the tick.

Goal:
Audio should reinforce rhythm, not create stress or annoyance.

3) Countdown urgency (last 10 seconds)
Urgency should motivate, not induce panic.

Requirements:
- Timer pulsing must be subtle (scale increase ≤6%).
- Red timer color should be readable and accessible in both light and dark mode.
- Countdown ticking should feel like a soft metronome, not a clock bomb.
- If user submits an answer during the last second, avoid race-condition glitches (no double sounds, no visual overlap).

Goal:
Create focus and flow, not pressure spikes.

4) Answer submission friction (VERY IMPORTANT)
Incorrect submission UX will seriously harm retention.

Requirements:
- Ensure users never accidentally submit incomplete multi-digit answers.
- Submission methods must be intentional:
  - Keyboard “Done/Enter” submits
  - OR tapping a large, clearly indicated submission area (e.g., question card)
- No tiny targets.
- No requirement to move focus between input and submit every time.
- Prevent double-submission or accidental re-submission.

Goal:
Answering should feel effortless and confident.

5) Assessment result messaging tone
Messaging here strongly influences whether users continue.

Requirements:
- Review all competence-level messages (1–10) for tone.
- Messages must be:
  - encouraging
  - specific
  - realistic
  - adult (not childish, not hypey)
- Avoid phrases that imply judgment, failure, or “low ability”.
- Avoid exaggerated promises (“you’ll be amazing”, “master maths fast”).
- Emphasize progress, trajectory, and control.

Goal:
User finishes assessment feeling optimistic and motivated, regardless of score.

6) Visual load and clarity
Avoid overstimulation.

Requirements:
- Ensure only ONE primary feedback signal per event (e.g., visual OR sound leads).
- Avoid simultaneous animations competing for attention.
- Keep typography large and readable during gameplay.
- No unnecessary UI elements during question answering.

Goal:
Maintain cognitive clarity and rhythm.

7) Consistency between Assessment and Training
Users should not feel like they are learning two different interfaces.

Requirements:
- Gameplay interaction, feedback timing, and visuals must behave identically in Assessment and Training.
- Only copy/messaging should differ.
- No surprise interaction changes post-assessment.

Goal:
Trust and predictability.

Please audit the current implementation against these points and adjust accordingly.
If trade-offs are required, prioritize:
1) Emotional safety
2) Low friction
3) Consistency
4) Performance

Do not add new features or redesign screens. This is a refinement pass only.
