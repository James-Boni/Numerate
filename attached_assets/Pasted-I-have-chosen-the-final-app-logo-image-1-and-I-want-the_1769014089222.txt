I have chosen the final app logo (image 1) and I want the UI/UX to be made visually and emotionally consistent with it. This is an aesthetic refinement pass, not a feature expansion.

1) Treat the logo as the single source of visual truth
The logo defines:
- Colour palette
- Visual tone
- Corner radius / softness
- Overall aesthetic (clean, calm, confident, adult)

All UI elements should feel like they belong to the same visual system as the logo.

2) Colour system (IMPORTANT)
- Limit the UI to the logo’s colours + white + neutral greys.
- Do NOT introduce extra accent colours.
- Green/blue tones from the logo should be used consistently for:
  - correct feedback
  - progress indicators
  - primary actions
- Red should be muted and used sparingly for errors only.

3) Typography & spacing
- Use a clean, modern sans-serif font.
- Prioritise readability and calmness over playfulness.
- Generous spacing, no clutter.
- Large, clear question text during gameplay.

4) Shapes & surfaces
- Buttons, cards, and containers should echo the logo’s softness (rounded corners, not sharp).
- Avoid heavy shadows or “material” depth.
- Keep surfaces flat and modern.

5) Animation & motion philosophy
- Animations should be subtle, fast, and purposeful.
- No bouncy, elastic, or playful motion.
- Micro-interactions only (e.g. small scale, fade, or colour transitions).
- Motion should reinforce clarity, not draw attention to itself.

6) Add a launch / loading screen
Add a simple loading screen:
- White background
- Logo centred
- Very subtle fade-in or scale-in (200–300ms)
- No spinner unless loading actually takes time
- Transition smoothly into the app once ready

This screen should communicate “quality and calm”, not excitement.

7) Consistency check
Ensure:
- Gameplay, assessment, progress, and settings all share the same visual language.
- No screen feels like it came from a different app.
- Feedback colours, sounds, and animations align with the logo’s tone.

Do NOT redesign flows or add features. This is a visual and experiential alignment pass only.
