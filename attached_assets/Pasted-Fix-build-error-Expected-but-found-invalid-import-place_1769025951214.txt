Fix build error — Expected "(" but found "{" (invalid import placement)

There is a syntax error in:

client/src/lib/store.ts

Error:

ERROR: Expected "(" but found "{"
221 | import { getBandFromLevel } from './logic/difficulty';


This indicates an ES module import statement is placed in an invalid location, most likely inside an object literal, function, or store initializer instead of at the top-level of the module.

Your task

Fix the file so that:

All import statements are at top-level module scope

No import appears inside:

functions

store definitions

callbacks

object literals

The app compiles with no Vite / esbuild errors

No logic or behavior is changed (structural fix only)

Required steps (must follow)
1. Locate the invalid import

Open client/src/lib/store.ts

Go to line ~221

Identify the import { getBandFromLevel } from './logic/difficulty';

Confirm that it is currently located:

inside a function

or inside a Zustand/Redux store initializer

or inside an object literal

This is invalid JavaScript / TypeScript syntax.

2. Move the import to module scope

Relocate the import to the top of the file, alongside other imports:

import { getBandFromLevel } from './logic/difficulty';


Ensure it appears before any executable code

Do NOT wrap it in any function or block

3. Ensure no duplicate or conflicting imports

Check whether getBandFromLevel is already imported elsewhere

Remove duplicates if necessary

Ensure the import path is correct and unchanged

4. Preserve behavior

Do NOT refactor logic

Do NOT change how getBandFromLevel is used

Only move the import so the file is syntactically valid

Mandatory self-verification (do not skip)

Before marking complete:

Confirm all imports in store.ts are at top-level

Confirm there are no import statements after executable code

Run the dev server and confirm:

No Expected "(" but found "{" error

No esbuild / Vite transform errors

Confirm app still starts and store initializes correctly

Required final response

After fixing, respond with:

Why the error occurred (import inside non-top-level scope)

Exactly what was changed (moved import to top-level)

Confirmation that the dev server runs without errors

Do not respond “fixed” unless all checks pass.
