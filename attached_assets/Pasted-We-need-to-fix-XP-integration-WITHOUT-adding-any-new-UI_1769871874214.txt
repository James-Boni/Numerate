We need to fix XP integration WITHOUT adding any new UI elements or debug panels.

Problem:
The session results XP currently counts only “additional/bonus XP” (accuracy/speed/etc) and ignores the in-game XP earned during play (shown top-right during the game). This breaks trust.

Requirement:
For every non-assessment session:
FinalSessionXP = InGameXP + BonusXP

User-facing UI:
- Show ONLY one combined number: “X XP”
- Do NOT show a breakdown.
- Do NOT add any debug block or developer panel to the UI.

Assessment:
- Assessment remains placement-only and grants 0 XP. Do not change that.

--------------------------------------------
A) Identify and standardize XP variables
--------------------------------------------
1) Locate where in-game XP is tracked during gameplay (top-right counter).
   Common names: score, points, xp, earnedXP, runXP, sessionXP, etc.
   Call this canonical value: inGameXP.

2) Locate where bonus XP is computed from post-session metrics (accuracy, speed, consistency, throughput, effort).
   Refactor this to a function that returns BONUS XP ONLY:
   computeBonusXP(metrics) -> { bonusXP, breakdown }

3) At session end, compute:
finalSessionXP = inGameXP + bonusXP

--------------------------------------------
B) Make finalSessionXP the single source of truth
--------------------------------------------
1) Store finalSessionXP in the session result record.
2) Apply finalSessionXP to leveling (xpIntoLevel += finalSessionXP).
3) Display finalSessionXP in the session results screen as “X XP”.
   Ensure the UI does not display bonusXP or inGameXP separately.

IMPORTANT:
- The displayed XP value must be the exact same finalSessionXP that gets applied and stored.

--------------------------------------------
C) Remove the bug pattern (first session after assessment)
--------------------------------------------
This often fails on the first Daily session due to state reset/race conditions.

Ensure:
- inGameXP is initialized to 0 at the start of EVERY session.
- inGameXP is incremented reliably on each correct answer (and streak/speed logic if applicable).
- the session summary is computed BEFORE session state is cleared/reset.
- sessionType is correctly “daily” (not “assessment” or “practice”) after the assessment.
- the results screen reads from the stored session result object, not live session state.

--------------------------------------------
D) Backend-only diagnostics (no UI)
--------------------------------------------
Add backend-only logging at session end (console only):
"XP_SUMMARY sessionType=<...> inGameXP=<...> bonusXP=<...> finalSessionXP=<...> appliedToLeveling=<...> storedFinal=<...>"

Add a DEV assertion:
If finalSessionXP !== inGameXP + bonusXP, log an error.

Also assert:
- XP applied to leveling == stored finalSessionXP == displayed XP value source

But do not display any of this in the UI.

--------------------------------------------
E) Tests (required)
--------------------------------------------
1) If inGameXP=600 and bonusXP=242, finalSessionXP must be 842, and 842 must be applied/stored/displayed.
2) Assessment session yields 0 XP and does not level up.
3) First Daily session after assessment still uses combined XP.

Return:
- Where inGameXP is sourced
- Where bonusXP is computed
- Where finalSessionXP is created/stored/applied
- Confirm results UI now shows combined XP as a single number.
