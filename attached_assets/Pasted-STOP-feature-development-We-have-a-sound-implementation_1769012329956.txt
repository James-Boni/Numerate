STOP feature development. We have a sound implementation failure and I need a full diagnostic, not assumptions.

Goal:
Identify exactly why sound effects are not playing and fix the root cause. Do NOT say “implemented” unless sound is audibly confirmed on a real device.

You must follow this diagnostic process step by step and log results.

--------------------------------------------------
STEP 1 — CONFIRM TEST ENVIRONMENT
--------------------------------------------------
Explicitly log and display (console + on-screen if needed):
- Whether the app is running on:
  - Web browser
  - iOS Simulator
  - Real iPhone via Expo Go / TestFlight

If running on web:
- State clearly that browser audio restrictions may block sound
- Still continue diagnostics, but prioritize real-device testing

--------------------------------------------------
STEP 2 — VERIFY SOUND ASSETS EXIST
--------------------------------------------------
Check the project file tree and CONFIRM the existence of actual audio files.

Required files (or equivalents):
- /src/assets/sounds/correct.(mp3|wav)
- /src/assets/sounds/wrong.(mp3|wav)
- /src/assets/sounds/tick.(mp3|wav)

If files do NOT exist:
- Add simple placeholder sound files immediately
- Use short, neutral UI-style sounds (not music)
- Log confirmation that files exist and are bundled

--------------------------------------------------
STEP 3 — VERIFY expo-av INSTALLATION
--------------------------------------------------
Confirm:
- expo-av is installed
- version is compatible with current Expo SDK
- Audio.Sound is imported correctly

Log:
- expo-av version
- confirmation that Audio.Sound is available at runtime

--------------------------------------------------
STEP 4 — ADD A SOUND TEST PANEL (MANDATORY)
--------------------------------------------------
Add a “Sound Diagnostic” section in Settings with THREE buttons:

1) “Play Correct Sound”
2) “Play Wrong Sound”
3) “Play Tick Sound”

Each button MUST:
- console.log("SOUND_TEST_<TYPE>_PRESSED")
- log current soundOn setting value
- attempt to load the audio using STATIC require()
- attempt to play the sound using async/await
- catch and console.error ANY error (do not swallow errors)

Example requirements (conceptual, not exact code):
- Use static require() paths
- Do NOT use dynamic paths
- Log before load, after load, before play, after play

If pressing these buttons produces no sound:
- Identify EXACTLY why before proceeding

--------------------------------------------------
STEP 5 — AUDIO MODE CONFIGURATION (iOS CRITICAL)
--------------------------------------------------
Explicitly configure Expo Audio mode.

You MUST decide and document:
- Should sounds play even when iOS silent switch is ON?

Default requirement for this app:
- YES, sounds should play in silent mode (game-like behavior)

Log:
- Audio mode configuration applied
- Whether silent switch is overridden

--------------------------------------------------
STEP 6 — VERIFY SETTINGS ARE NOT MUTING SOUND
--------------------------------------------------
Inspect soundOn setting:
- Confirm default value on first install
- Confirm toggle actually updates state
- Confirm sound playback functions do NOT early-return incorrectly

Log soundOn value at every attempted playback.

--------------------------------------------------
STEP 7 — CONFIRM PLAYBACK WORKS VIA TEST PANEL
--------------------------------------------------
At this point:
- Pressing test buttons MUST produce audible sound on a real device

If NOT:
- Stop and explain the exact failure point:
  - missing assets
  - incorrect path
  - audio mode issue
  - environment restriction
  - expo-av failure

DO NOT proceed until test panel works.

--------------------------------------------------
STEP 8 — TRACE GAMEPLAY SOUND TRIGGERS
--------------------------------------------------
Only AFTER the test panel works:

Add explicit console logs at these exact moments:
- Number button pressed
- Answer submission triggered
- Answer confirmed correct
- Answer confirmed wrong

At confirmation:
- Log "CONFIRMED_CORRECT" or "CONFIRMED_WRONG"
- Immediately call the same sound functions used by test panel

If logs fire but no sound:
- The issue is sound lifecycle or async handling — fix it

If logs do NOT fire:
- The issue is event wiring — fix it

--------------------------------------------------
STEP 9 — PREVENT COMMON FAILURES
--------------------------------------------------
Ensure:
- Sounds are NOT recreated every render
- Sound objects are properly unloaded when needed
- No overlapping playback unless intentional
- No race conditions with timer ticks vs answer sounds
- Tick sound is suppressed if answer sound fires at same moment

--------------------------------------------------
FINAL REQUIREMENT
--------------------------------------------------
Do NOT say “sound implemented”.

Instead, provide:
1) Confirmation that sound plays on a REAL iPhone
2) Which test proved it
3) Any fixes applied
4) Remaining limitations (e.g., web restrictions)

If sound still does not play, identify the SINGLE blocking cause clearly.
