You are helping me convert my existing React + Vite mobile-first web app (currently served as a PWA-style site on Replit) into an iOS app project that I can open in Xcode and eventually upload to TestFlight/App Store.

IMPORTANT CONTEXT
- This is not a React Native app. It is React + Vite running in the browser (URL works as a normal website).
- I want to keep the codebase mostly unchanged and wrap it using Capacitor.
- The goal for this task is: produce an Xcode-compatible iOS project that runs the *bundled* web assets locally (NOT a webview that loads a remote URL at runtime).
- My later goals are Sign in with Apple (SIWA) + Apple In-App Purchases (IAP), but for now just create the correct Capacitor iOS shell, with a clean foundation for native integrations.

TASKS (DO THESE IN ORDER)
1) Add Capacitor to the existing Vite project:
   - Install @capacitor/core, @capacitor/cli, and @capacitor/ios.
   - Initialize Capacitor with:
     - appName: Numerate
     - appId: com.<myname>.numerate (use a placeholder like com.example.numerate if you must; I will replace later)
   - Configure Capacitor to use Vite’s build output folder (likely "dist") as the webDir.

2) Ensure the app runs from local bundled assets:
   - Configure the iOS app to load local web assets produced by `npm run build`, not the remote Replit URL.
   - Add build + sync scripts:
     - build: `vite build`
     - cap:sync: `npx cap sync ios`
     - cap:open: `npx cap open ios`
   - Make sure `npm run build` then `npx cap sync ios` results in the iOS project using the latest dist output.

3) Routing / deep link handling:
   - The app uses client-side routing (e.g. /assessment). Ensure Capacitor routing works with Vite build so that direct navigation to routes does not 404 inside the native wrapper.
   - If needed, adjust Vite base path / history fallback so the built app works inside the iOS wrapper.

4) iOS project generation:
   - Add the iOS platform: `npx cap add ios`
   - Confirm an `ios/` folder is created with an Xcode project/workspace.
   - Provide exact instructions for how I open and run it in Xcode.

5) App-like behaviour (avoid “simple web wrapper” problems):
   - Ensure the iOS build behaves like an app:
     - correct status bar / safe area handling
     - prevent accidental zoom (if that’s currently handled in the web app, keep it)
   - Do NOT simply embed a remote website URL in a webview.
   - Confirm the build works offline (at least it should load the UI without network).

OUTPUT REQUIREMENTS
- Tell me exactly which files you changed/added.
- Show the final `capacitor.config` (or capacitor.config.ts/json) and confirm webDir points to dist.
- Provide step-by-step commands I should run in Replit to generate the iOS project:
  - npm install
  - npm run build
  - npx cap sync ios
  - npx cap open ios
- List any required environment tweaks for Replit (if any).

DO NOT DO
- Do not migrate to React Native or Expo.
- Do not redesign my UI.
- Do not add SIWA or IAP yet.
- Do not rely on the remote Replit URL at runtime.

GOAL CHECK
At the end, I should have an iOS project that I can open in Xcode and run on a simulator/device, showing my Numerate app from bundled assets.
