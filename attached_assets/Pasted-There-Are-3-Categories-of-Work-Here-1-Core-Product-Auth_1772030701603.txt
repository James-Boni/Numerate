There Are 3 Categories of Work Here
1️⃣ Core Product Authority (Value Creation)
Decimal correctness
Generator validation integrity
Difficulty ramp integrity
Reward flow polish
Progress clarity
Milestone structure
2️⃣ Retention Mechanics
Streak system
Push notifications
Onboarding polish
Haptics
3️⃣ Infrastructure (Monetisation & Compliance)
Real IAP
Sign in with Apple
Bundle ID
App Store Connect setup
Privacy policy
Assets
Now here’s the key insight:
You cannot justify £1/month if category 1 is not airtight.
But you cannot ship if category 3 is missing.
So What Is The Correct Order?
Not emotional.
Not philosophical.
Strategic.
Phase A: Lock Authority First
Because charging money amplifies flaws.
If someone pays £1 and:
A decimal is incorrectly marked wrong
XP miscounts
Difficulty jumps erratically
A milestone unlock feels random
They will churn immediately.
So before monetisation infrastructure, the product must feel inevitable.
This is especially true for Numerate because your brand is “serious training”.
Phase B: Infrastructure Once Product Is Stable
Once you’re confident that:
Trust is unbreakable
Progress feels meaningful
Reward flow feels premium
Then integrate:
RevenueCat / StoreKit
SIWA
App Store configuration
That becomes mechanical execution.
What You Should NOT Do
Do not:
Build IAP
Build SIWA
Go through App Store setup
…while the core training system still needs structural refinement.
Why?
Because infrastructure work is mentally heavy but does not improve product quality.
It feels productive.
It isn’t value-creating.
What Actually Matters Right Now?
Answer this honestly:
If you gave Numerate to 10 intelligent adults tomorrow…
Would they:
A) Say “this feels solid and serious”
B) Or say “this is promising but slightly rough”
If it’s B, you stay in Phase A.
Your Current Stage (From Everything You’ve Told Me)
You are still in refinement.
Specifically:
XP inconsistency was recently an issue.
Difficulty ramp is still being tuned.
Progress insights could be stronger.
Milestone signalling is not fully surfaced.
That means:
You are not yet at monetisation layer.
You are still shaping authority.
Important Strategic Reality
At £1/month, this app doesn’t need 100 features.
It needs:
Trust
Visible improvement
Emotional weight
Clean polish
That’s it.
So Was Your Replit Response Focus Correct?
Yes — because you were clarifying philosophy before execution.
But.
Now the real next step isn’t debating milestone UI.
It’s this:
“Is the arithmetic engine unbreakable?”
If not, that is priority 1.
Clean Next Step I Would Take
Go back to Replit and say:
Before we implement IAP or SIWA, I want to perform a full validation audit of:
– Decimal handling
– Generator capability enforcement
– XP calculation consistency
– Difficulty progression compliance with level capability model
Please audit and identify any inconsistencies or edge-case risks.
That is founder-level prioritisation.
Final Strategic Answer
No.
You should not jump to infrastructure yet.
Yes.
You should focus on core product integrity first.
Because when you finally wire up IAP, you want zero doubt.
You want to feel:
“This is ready to charge for.”
And right now, you’re still polishing the blade.
Let me ask you something serious:
If Numerate launched in its current state and 1,000 people downloaded it next week…
Would you feel proud?
Or slightly anxious?
