This screen needs to feel significantly more rewarding and data-driven after completing the 3-minute Daily Training. Please implement a polished result-reveal sequence with animation + sound. This is NOT a redesign of layout, only behavior and feedback.

1) XP Count-Up Animation (Primary Reward)
- When the screen loads, XP should start at 0.
- Animate rapidly upward to the final XP value the user earned.
- Duration: ~600–900ms (fast, energetic, not slow).
- Use smooth, non-bouncy easing (easeOut or linear).
- XP number should feel like it is “tallying” results.

Sound:
- Play a short, magical-but-clean “energy rise” sound during the count-up.
- Sound should:
  - be modern, subtle, and fast
  - communicate accumulation/progress
  - NOT be a jingle or melody
- Sound should stop exactly when the XP count finishes.

2) Accuracy & Speed Count-Up (Secondary Rewards)
- Accuracy (%) and Speed (seconds) should also animate from 0 to their final values.
- Animation should begin slightly AFTER XP starts (staggered by ~100–200ms).
- Duration: ~500–700ms each.

Sound:
- Use a “computer-like / analytical” ticking or digital counting sound.
- Think: financial dashboard / numbers updating / money going up on a screen.
- Sound must be:
  - short
  - precise
  - non-musical
  - quiet enough for repetition
- Sound should stop cleanly when the number reaches its final value.

3) Exceptional Performance Highlight (Accuracy ≥ 95%)
If accuracy is 95% or higher:
- Accuracy number should:
  - transition to the same green used by the Accuracy target icon
  - become slightly emboldened (not oversized)
- Trigger a single, short, satisfying bell/chime sound.
  - Duration ≤ 250ms
  - Clean, magical, but restrained
  - No sparkle, no flourish
- This sound must play AFTER the accuracy count-up completes.

4) Timing & Flow (CRITICAL)
- All sounds must be tightly synchronized to their animations.
- No sound should continue after the animation finishes.
- No overlapping sounds unless intentional (XP vs stats should not clash).
- The entire reveal sequence should complete in ~1.2–1.5 seconds total.
- The screen must feel responsive immediately (no lag before animations start).

5) Visual Philosophy
- No confetti, fireworks, or celebratory explosions.
- This should feel like “performance feedback”, not a game win screen.
- Clean, confident, adult, satisfying.

6) Accessibility & Settings
- Respect sound toggle: if sound is off, animations still play silently.
- Ensure color contrast remains accessible when accuracy turns green.

Please confirm:
- Which sounds were used/replaced
- How animations are sequenced
- That the result was tested on a real iPhone
