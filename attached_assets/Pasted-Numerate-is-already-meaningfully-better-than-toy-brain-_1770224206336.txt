Numerate is already meaningfully better than “toy” brain apps, but it is not yet emotionally compelling enough to justify a paywall in its current form.

That’s good news — because the gap is fixable, and it’s not about adding features. It’s about tightening flow, difficulty signalling, and reward clarity.

You’re closer than you probably feel.

What’s working well (you should keep these)
1. Core loop is sound

Assessment → placement → daily training → progress

This is fundamentally correct

Nothing feels conceptually wrong or misguided

You are not building the wrong product.

2. Input speed + low friction is good

Number entry is fast

Confirmation feels immediate

No unnecessary UI taps

This is critical for a maths fluency app, and you’ve nailed it.

3. Visual language is calm and credible

Colours are not gimmicky

UI feels “serious” rather than gamey

This suits your target user (adults who feel bad at maths)

Do not turn this into Duolingo-style chaos.

Where the app is currently leaking value

These are the real problems, ordered by impact.

🔴 1. Difficulty does not feel tied to level yet

This is the biggest issue — and you already sensed it.

From the video:

Level changes, but question texture barely changes

At higher levels, the cognitive effort doesn’t rise fast enough

Users won’t trust the system if L20 doesn’t feel different from L10

Even if the generator technically changes, perception is what matters.

Why this is dangerous

If users don’t feel difficulty rising:

levels feel arbitrary

progress feels hollow

paying feels unjustified

What to fix (without new features)

Increase minimum complexity per level band

Reduce “freebie” questions aggressively at higher levels

Make harder operations visibly harder (digit length, carries, division structure)

Level must be something the user can sense without being told.

🔴 2. Reward moments are too quiet

This is the second biggest issue.

In the recording:

XP increases, but it’s understated

Level changes don’t land emotionally

The user’s brain doesn’t get a clear “YES, that mattered” signal

Right now it feels like:

“I did a thing. Numbers changed.”

You want:

“I did a thing. That meant something.”

Concrete problems

XP number changes too subtly

Level-up moments are visually similar to normal progression

Sounds are present but not decisive

What to fix

Stronger contrast between:

normal XP gain

level-up XP crossing

One unmistakable “level-up” moment

Slight pause + emphasis when leveling occurs

This is not about fireworks — it’s about clarity.

🟠 3. Progress page is informative but not instructive

The Progress page shows data, but it doesn’t yet teach the user how to read it.

From the video:

Charts exist, but meaning is implicit

User must infer improvement

No clear “then vs now” framing

Why this matters

People don’t pay for charts.
They pay for confidence that effort → improvement.

What to improve

Clear comparison language:

“You’re answering X% faster than last week”

“Accuracy improved even as difficulty increased”

Emphasise trends, not raw values

Make one insight the headline, not all metrics equal

You already planned this — it’s the right next move.

🟠 4. Cinematic moments need tightening (not expanding)

You have the right idea with cinematic placement and transitions — but timing is slightly off.

From the recording:

Some moments linger a fraction too long

Others pass too quickly to register

Rule of thumb

Success moments: slow down by ~15%

Routine transitions: speed up by ~10–20%

This keeps flow intact while still rewarding effort.

🟡 5. Quick Fire mode is conceptually good but not yet essential

Quick Fire:

is fun

trains speed

does not currently add perceived value beyond the Daily

That’s fine — but it should feel like training, not another obligation.

I’d recommend:

De-emphasising it in UI for now

Positioning it as optional speed practice

Making sure it does not influence core progress metrics (you already identified this)

This is not a blocker for launch.
