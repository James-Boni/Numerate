We are implementing a major UX/UI polish pass focused on perceived quality, clarity, and reward. This is NOT optional polish — these are core experiential features.

Do NOT introduce new product logic.
Do NOT change difficulty or XP formulas.
Do NOT break existing flows.
All changes must respect Numerate’s existing colour scheme, typography, and tone.

====================================================================
A) LOGO BACKGROUND FIX (GLOBAL)
====================================================================
Problem:
The Numerate logo currently renders with a white rounded-square background, making the app feel unpolished.

Requirement:
- Remove the white box background entirely.
- The logo must render as JUST the brain shape with transparency.
- Background behind the logo should be whatever the screen background is (e.g. app background colour).
- This applies to:
  - loading/splash screen
  - any in-app logo usage
  - any placement / celebration screens

Implementation notes:
- Use a transparent PNG/SVG if available.
- Do NOT simulate transparency by matching background colour.
- Confirm no white bounding box remains.

Acceptance:
- Logo visually “floats” cleanly on any background.

====================================================================
B) INITIAL ASSESSMENT RETRY FEATURE (CRITICAL UX FIX)
====================================================================
Problem:
If a user answers fewer than 12 questions, the app recommends retrying for accuracy — but there is no retry mechanism.

Requirements:
1) Retry eligibility:
- If attemptedQuestions < 12:
  - Assessment is considered incomplete.
  - Placement is NOT locked.
  - User may retry freely.

2) Retry UI:
When <12 questions are answered, show a clear message:
“Answer a few more questions for a more accurate placement.”

Buttons:
- “Retry Assessment” (primary)
- “Continue Anyway” (secondary, optional — only if you think placement can still work)

3) Retry behavior:
- “Retry Assessment” restarts the assessment immediately.
- Clear all assessment-specific state:
  - questions
  - counters
  - timers
- Do NOT write placement results to user profile until a valid attempt.

4) Retry limits:
- No hard cap on retries while attemptedQuestions < 12.
- Once attemptedQuestions ≥ 12, retry is no longer offered automatically.

Acceptance:
- Users are never told to retry without having a way to do so.
- Placement only locks after a valid attempt.

====================================================================
C) CINEMATIC PLACEMENT MOMENT (HIGH IMPACT)
====================================================================
Problem:
Placement currently works logically but lacks emotional weight.

Goal:
Make placement feel important, earned, and motivating — without being gimmicky.

Requirements:
1) Placement screen structure:
- Full-screen moment.
- Dimmed or soft background.
- Logo (transparent, no white box) subtly present.

2) Visual sequencing (fast, ~1.5–2s total):
- “Assessment Complete” appears.
- Short pause.
- Level number animates in (scale + fade).
- Confidence message appears below.

3) Audio:
- Soft, satisfying “success” sound on placement reveal.
- No loud fanfare.
- One clean sound only.

4) Copy rules:
- Confidence message must be relevant to placement level.
- Tone:
  - encouraging
  - forward-looking
  - never condescending

Example tone (not exact copy):
“Your foundations are solid. With focused practice, your fluency will grow quickly.”

Acceptance:
- Placement feels like a meaningful milestone.
- User feels optimistic, not judged.

====================================================================
D) XP → LEVEL PROGRESSION BAR (TRAIN MENU + POST-GAME)
====================================================================
Problem:
Users can’t clearly see how close they are to the next level, and leveling up lacks impact.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
D1) Progress bar in Train menu (persistent)
--------------------------------------------------------------------
Requirements:
- At the top of the Train screen, near Level + XP.
- Horizontal bar showing:
  - current XP progress within current level
  - distance to next level
- Colour must match Numerate palette.
- Smooth animation on XP changes.

Acceptance:
- User can always answer: “How close am I to leveling up?”

--------------------------------------------------------------------
D2) Level-up celebration flow (post-game)
--------------------------------------------------------------------
Trigger:
- If a game causes the user to reach a new level.

Flow:
1) Game summary screen finishes.
2) Transition to a dedicated “Level Up” screen.

Level Up screen requirements:
- XP bar animates rapidly from previous state → fills → crosses threshold.
- Level number increments visually.
- Bar resets into new level state if applicable.
- Animation must be smooth, fast, and satisfying (not slow).

Audio:
- One clean, rewarding level-up sound.
- Louder and more celebratory than normal XP gain.
- No overlapping sounds.

Visuals:
- Subtle glow or accent animation.
- No confetti overload.
- Respect Numerate’s clean aesthetic.

Acceptance:
- Leveling up feels unquestionably rewarding.
- Users instantly understand what just happened.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
D3) Multi-level gains (edge case)
--------------------------------------------------------------------
If a single session causes multiple level-ups:
- Animate through levels quickly.
- Do NOT skip the feedback.
- Keep total animation under ~3 seconds.

====================================================================
E) COHERENCE & SAFETY
====================================================================
- All XP shown must equal XP applied and stored.
- user.level remains the single source of truth.
- No duplicate bars or conflicting indicators.
- No new settings or toggles added.

====================================================================
F) REPORTING
====================================================================
After implementation, report:
- Files modified
- Where assessment retry logic lives
- How placement lock is prevented until valid
- How XP bar calculates fill %
- Where level-up animation is triggered
