Add a DEV-ONLY “Dev Menu” to speed up testing without replaying the assessment. This must be implemented safely and must NOT affect production builds or break existing flows.

CRITICAL SAFETY REQUIREMENTS
1) Dev Menu must ONLY exist in development:
- It must not render in production builds.
- It must not alter any production behavior.
- Use a single central boolean like:
  const SHOW_DEV_MENU = __DEV__ (React Native/Expo)
  OR (import.meta.env.MODE !== "production") (Vite)
  OR (process.env.NODE_ENV !== "production")
Pick the correct one for this codebase, and use it consistently.

2) No refactors:
- Do not refactor navigation or state architecture.
- Only add the minimum code needed.
- Reuse existing store/persistence helpers.

3) All Dev Menu actions must use the same setters/actions the app normally uses:
- No duplicate state systems.
- No direct mutation.
- Ensure changes persist and reflect immediately.

ENTRY POINT (SAFE)
Add a “Dev Menu” row/button at the bottom of Settings, inside a “Developer” section.
- Visible ONLY when SHOW_DEV_MENU is true.
- In production, this row must not exist at all.

DEV MENU SCREEN / MODAL
Create a simple Dev Menu screen (or modal) with these controls:

A) QUICK NAVIGATION (buttons)
- Go to Train
- Go to Daily Challenge
- Go to Quick Fire
- Go to Progress
- Go to Settings/Home (whatever is appropriate)
Use the existing navigation method.

B) STATE TOGGLES / SETTERS (write-through to persistence)
1) Toggle: hasCompletedAssessment (true/false)
- This controls gating for Daily/Quick Fire.
- Add confirmation when turning it OFF (since it can hide modes).

2) Set initialAssessmentLevel (number input + “Apply”)
- Validate integer range (1–100).
- Store as user.initialAssessmentLevel.

3) Set current level (user.level) (number input + “Apply”)
- Validate integer range (1–200 allowed; the game is effectively unbounded but keep it sane).
- user.level remains the single source of truth for difficulty.

4) Button: “Clear Daily History”
- Deletes only stored session records where sessionType === "daily".
- Must not delete assessment or user profile.

5) Button: “Clear Quick Fire Stats”
- Clears only quick fire fields:
  - quickFireHighScore
  - quickFireAttempts
  - any quick_fire session records (if stored)
- Must not affect daily history.

6) Button: “Reset All Progress”
- Calls the REAL reset function you implemented (returns user.level to initialAssessmentLevel, clears progress charts, streaks, PBs, etc.).
- Confirmation required.

C) CONFIRMATIONS (MANDATORY)
For destructive actions, show a confirmation modal:
- Clear Daily History
- Clear Quick Fire Stats
- Reset All Progress
Modal must have:
- Cancel (default)
- Confirm (destructive)

PERSISTENCE + UI COHERENCE (MANDATORY)
- After any Dev Menu change:
  - Update in-memory store
  - Update persistent storage (same mechanism the app already uses)
  - UI must reflect changes immediately
- If the app uses a query cache, invalidate/recompute derived values as needed so Progress updates.

GUARDRAILS / FAIL SAFELY
- If user.initialAssessmentLevel is missing, disable Reset All Progress and show hint:
  “Complete assessment first.”
- If a user enters invalid levels, show a small inline validation message and do nothing.

DELIVERABLES
After implementing, report:
- Files added/modified
- Where SHOW_DEV_MENU is defined
- How production hiding is enforced
- Which store actions are used for each control
- What keys are cleared by each destructive action

IMPORTANT:
- Do not change any existing UI unless needed to add the single “Dev Menu” row in Settings.
- Do not introduce new libraries.
- Keep this feature completely isolated and easy to remove later.
